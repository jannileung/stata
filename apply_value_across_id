/*
*Example scenario:
  *data is long;
  *each participant have rows of data for each visit;
  *in some visits, training was provided;
  *aim is to keep only the participants with training;
  
*variables are: id is id, "trained" is 1 if trained, . if not trained;

*Strategy is sort by id and trained, 
  *then create a new variable called "trainedever" 
      *1 for all rows of data for participants who ever were trained;
*/


*sort by id and trained (trained is 1 if trained, . if not trained);
              bysort id (trained): gen trainedever = trained[1]
              
              
*drop if trainedever is missing;
              drop if trainedever == .
